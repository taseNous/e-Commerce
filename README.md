WordPress is a widely-used open-source content management system (CMS) that enables users 
to create, manage, and publish websites and blogs. It is built on PHP and uses a MySQL or 
MariaDB database to store content. Known for its ease of use and flexibility, WordPress 
powers a significant portion of websites on the internet, from personal blogs to large 
corporate websites and e-commerce platforms.
